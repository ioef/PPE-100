q1:
A website requires the users to input username and password to register. Write a program to check the validity of password input by users.
Following are the criteria for checking the password:
1. At least 1 letter between [a-z]
2. At least 1 number between [0-9]
1. At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
3. At least 1 character from [$#@]
4. Minimum length of transaction password: 6
5. Maximum length of transaction password: 12
Your program should accept a sequence of comma separated passwords and will check them according to the above criteria. Passwords that match the criteria are to be printed, each separated by a comma.
Example
If the following passwords are given as input to the program:
ABd1234@1,a F1#,2w3E*,2We3345
Then, the output of the program should be:
ABd1234@1

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

q2:
You are required to write a program to sort the (name, age, height) tuples by ascending order where name is string, age and height are numbers. The tuples are input by console. The sort criteria is:
1: Sort based on name;
2: Then sort based on age;
3: Then sort by score.
The priority is that name > age > score.
If the following tuples are given as input to the program:
Tom,19,80
John,20,90
Jony,17,91
Jony,17,93
Json,21,85
Then, the output of the program should be:
[('John', '20', '90'), ('Jony', '17', '91'), ('Jony', '17', '93'), ('Json', '21', '85'), ('Tom', '19', '80')]

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
We use itemgetter to enable multiple sort keys.

Solutions:
from operator import itemgetter, attrgetter

q3:
Question:
Define a class with a generator which can iterate the numbers, which are divisible by 7, between a given range 0 and n.

Hints:
Consider use yield

q4:
A robot moves in a plane starting from the original point (0,0). The robot can move toward UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT with a given steps. The trace of robot movement is shown as the following:
UP 5
DOWN 3
LEFT 3
RIGHT 2
¡­
The numbers after the direction are steps. Please write a program to compute the distance from current position after a sequence of movement and original point. If the distance is a float, then just print the nearest integer.
Example:
If the following tuples are given as input to the program:
UP 5
DOWN 3
LEFT 3
RIGHT 2
Then, the output of the program should be:
2

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
By actually calculating the hypotenuse you can find the distance.

q5:
Question:
Write a program to compute the frequency of the words from the input. The output should output after sorting the key alphanumerically. 
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
New to Python or choosing between Python 2 and Python 3? Read Python 2 or Python 3.
Then, the output should be:
2:2
3.:1
3?:1
New:1
Python:5
Read:1
and:1
between:1
choosing:1
or:2
to:1

Hints
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.


q6:
Question:
Write a program which can filter even numbers in a list by using filter function. The list is: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10].

Hints:
Use filter() to filter some elements in a list.
Use lambda to define anonymous functions.

q7:
Write a program which can map() to make a list whose elements are square of elements in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10].

Hints:
Use map() to generate a list.
Use lambda to define anonymous functions.

q8:
Write a program which can map() and filter() to make a list whose elements are square of even number in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10].

Hints:
Use map() to generate a list.
Use filter() to filter elements of a list.
Use lambda to define anonymous functions.
